		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<h3>October Wind (2008 Demo)</h3>
		Feel the deadly cold<br/>
		Freeze you from within<br/>
		Icy grip of death<br/>
		Clenches round your mind<br/><br/>

		Feel the winds blowing<br/>
		Makes your cheeks red<br/>
		October&#39s wind is cold<br/><br/>

		Feel the deadly cold<br/>
		Freeze you from inside<br/>
		Icy grip of death<br/>
		Takes your life<br/><br/>

		Winter it comes with deadly cold<br/>
		Spine chilling frost...<br/>
		Winter it comes with deadly cold<br/>
		Spine chilling frost...<br/><br/>

		<em>&#169 2008 Mike Brewer</em><br/><br/>



		<h3>New Religion (2008 Demo)</h3>
		Taken away from the madness of living your life in...<br/>
		These endless days and nights spent in strife<br/>
		Nevermore will their piercing eyes pry in<br/>
		They&#39ll never know really what&#39s going on inside<br/><br/>

		We will show them all the truth realized<br/>
		The time it is now to come and rise<br/>
		Come and rise...<br/><br/>

		All the same!<br/>
		Once you realize this<br/>
		All you know will change<br/>

		Darkness, leaving your vision<br/>
		Spectrum of colors washing your eyes of a new faith<br/>
		Not one of lies no but one of the truth, one of honor, one that is real...<br/><br/>

		We will show them all the truth realized<br/>
		The time it is now to come and rise<br/><br/>

		All your days<br/>
		Ripped apart<br/>
		See your soul<br/>
		Devoured by god <br/><br/>

		<em>&#169 2008 Mike Brewer</em><br/><br/>


		<h3>Stripped of Rights (2008 Demo)</h3>
		You&#39ve seen all that&#39s came before<br/>
		Fall to the wayside<br/>
		We stand tall in the new generation<br/>
		Born from an evil mind<br/><br/>

		Cut from a cloth that&#39s long been burned<br/>
		Burnt to be forgotten<br/>
		But we rise from the ashes of old<br/>
		Rise to power<br/><br/>

		Taken away from all you know<br/>
		Thrust into the darkened hole<br/>
		Away your fucking rights we&#39ll push<br/><br/>

		You&#39ve been stripped of rights all your worldly&#39; possessions taken from you<br/>
		No land, no home, no wife and kids, no place where you can run to<br/><br/>
		
		What&#39s that? To hell you say...<br/>
		Fuck that!<br/><br/>

		What&#39s that? Imminent domain...<br/>
		FUCK THAT!<br/><br/>

		You&#39ve been stripped of rights all your worldly possessions taken from you<br/>
		No land, no home, no wife and kids, no place where you can run to!<br/><br/>
