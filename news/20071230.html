  <p>Backwater Burial advanced to the final round and received 10th place in the Lake Cumberland Battle of the Bands.  The band ranked in at 2nd place in the online poll before the battle due to the votes of some loyal fans.  Thanks go out to the people at Clear Channel who organized this and also to everyone who supported the band during this brutal weekend.</p>
