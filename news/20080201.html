  <p>Backwater Burial has finished recording a new demo album at Secret Studio in Nashville, TN.  Big thanks to Curtis for hooking us up with some quality studio time.  The new tracks should be mastered and ready within a couple weeks, we hope to have them on the merch table along with some <strong>NEW</strong> shirts and stickers before we do the Morristown and London shows this month.</p>
