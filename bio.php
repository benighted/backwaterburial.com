		<p>Backwater Burial rose from the murky swamps of southeastern Kentucky in early 2007.  The native men who would gather to form the band came from various other groups in the area along with a new import from southern Florida's metal scene.  Each member is a hardened veteran of the stage with years of musical experience to throw in to the mix.</p>
		<p>Drummer Scott Campbell came to Appalachia from Florida and coined the name "Backwater Burial" for a new project with local guitarist Bobby Jones.  A second guitarist, Jordy Davis, was added along with the band's original vocalist and bassist to form the first incarnation of Backwater Burial.  Michael Payne later came along to fill the bassist position and shortly afterward local radio personality "Metal Mike" Brewer took control of the microphone.  All members share a passion for heavy music with dark overtones, but each one also contributes their own distinct and original musical style.</p>
		<p>The music of Backwater Burial is a new and envigorating blend of old school Thrash Metal, Death Metal, and Southern Rock.  Their goal is to steer heavy music back to its roots and show everyone how it was and how it should be.  The band writes and primarily performs their own original music, with one or two cover songs thrown in to each live show to appeal to a wider audience.  Backwater Burial shows are always entertaining for both the band and the crowd, often attracting patrons who were not previously fans of metal, and bringing back those who have been jaded by the flood of horrid Hardcore and Nu-Metal bands in the last decade.</p>
		<p>Now is the time for change, and Backwater Burial is ready to step out and move some heads.  This is not a gimmick or marketing attempt, and the band has been known to take a loss just so they can get out with friends and fans and play the music that they love.  This is pure homegrown heavy metal done for enjoyment, not for employment!</p>
